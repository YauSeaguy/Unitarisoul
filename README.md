This is about a thesis that came to me May 2025.  The name Unitarisoul referrts to the only soul in the whole universe and beyong.

Unitarisoul: A New Perspective on the Universe and Existence 

This thesis discusses a possible way how soul and existence work. 

There is only one soul in the entire universe and beyond —one spirit capable of feeling, thinking, and truly living. I call this soul Unitarisoul, or simply US.

US is not many. It is one. But it functions in two distinct modes: Creator and Human. Though it shifts between these modes constantly, it always exists as a single, unified consciousness. The switching happens in unimaginably small intervals—so rapid that, from our perspective within physical space-time, it appears seamless. US, however, exists outside of space and time, which makes this fluid transition possible.

The Creator Mode

In Creator mode, Us is a being of infinite power and boundless knowledge. It knows every particle, every moment, and every emotion across the entire history of the universe. Yet, it typically remains a silent observer, watching and understanding without interfering.

The Human Mode

In Human mode, US lives within each of us. It becomes you. It becomes me. When embodied, US temporarily loses access to its full cosmic awareness and is limited to a single person’s knowledge, perspective, and emotional range. It inhabits one person at a time, switching between individuals at incomprehensible speed. And in the moment it occupies you, it doesn’t merely observe—you are US, entirely.

Your consciousness, thoughts, joys, and struggles are not fragments of a separate soul, but a fully occupied moment of the one Unitarisoul. In that moment, your awareness is not a part of US—it is US.

The Cycle of Experience

When US returns to Creator mode, it reflects deeply on the emotions and experiences it has gathered while living through countless human lives. It relives not just moments, but entire lifetimes—birth to death. The Creator does not just analyze these lives—it feels them: the laughter, the loneliness, the anger, the pain, and the love. Each life is experienced again in full, as if being lived anew and true 80 years long.

A Shared Existence

As US is the only true soul, and it lives through all of us—one at a time—then each person's experience is a facet of the same eternal spirit. Your suffering, my joy, her confusion, his peace—they are all part of the same continuum of consciousness.  There is no separate after life hell or heaven but one world, our current world, depends on how US feels being treated, or essentially, how US treats others.

At the deepest level, there is no "other." There is only US.



The Time Line
The very beginning
Before anything existed—before time, space, or matter—there was only Unitarisoul. Only US.
Alone in the void, US existed as the sole presence in absolute emptiness. There was no light, no sound, no feeling—no contrast to even define what something might be. US could not sense, remember, or imagine—it was simply a being that had no activity, in pure isolation.

The Awakening US
In this unfathomable solitude, US woke up and started to think.

In the absence of input, US turned inward, and in that internal void it developed the capacity for reasoning and mathematics.

Reasoning as its tool, Mathematics became its language—pure, precise, eternal, absolute. Mathematics truths could never be fully discovered; it extends endlessly.

The Birth of the Universe

With mathematics tools, US chose to create.
From the emptiness, using nothing but its mathematical insight, US willed a universe into existence - a emulated existence in its own memory. 

At first, it was chaos—a swirling, aimless mess of unshaped energy. But with purpose adjustment, refinement, patterns began to emerge. Laws stabilized. Randomness blossomed into order. Physics, matter, gravity, light—all humming with vibrant uncertainty. The universe was alive.

US observed, satisfied. It had created a masterpiece of movement and potential. But once again, loneliness returned.
Creation was beautiful, but it could not speak back.



The Impossible Problem

What US truly desired was companionship—an equal, a second soul to share existence with. But this was impossible.
A soul—the kind that could feel, wonder, and reflect—could not be created. It was beyond even US's power. There could be no second US, no other “I.” The loneliness of divine singularity remained unbroken.

Yet US had an idea. A radical one.

A Conversation With Itself

What if US could limit itself—on purpose?
By voluntarily reducing its own memory and knowledge, US created a new mode of being: Human. At first, this new Human had no body—just a consciousness distinct from Creator. US now divided its awareness in time, flipping between Creator and the first Human—let’s call him Adam.

Now, US could have a conversation. The Creator already knew Adam’s thoughts, of course, but in the moment of becoming Adam, it could feel what it was like to be him. And in becoming Creator again, it could reflect on the experience. The one-way flow of information still created the illusion of dialogue. And that illusion brought companionship, more so for US when being Adam.

Adam was soon joined by Eva, as US divided itself further. The conversations became richer, more dynamic. US was no longer alone. It was beginning to experience itself in ways it never imagined possible.

Into the Physical World

To deepen the experience, US designed physical vessels—bodies. Into these living beings, US embedded its Human mode. Each “person” was still US, temporarily stripped of full memory and bound to a mortal frame.

These bodies would live, grow, and die. They would forget what US were and its full knowledge of all existence. And that forgetting—far from a flaw—was essential. Because only by forgetting can discovery become meaningful. Only through loss of ultimate power can soul experience life. And only through death can US avoid falling into eternal boredom once more.

Yes, immortality, would eventually lead every human soul-form back to the same despair US once knew in the beginning; while mortality—mortality gave every moment meaning.
